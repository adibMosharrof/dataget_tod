System: Can you tell me the date when you will take the flight, and from where will you depart for the flight?
User: I will be departing on Thursday next week and the location from where I will start my trip is Mexico City.
System: I see that 3 flights match your request. How would you consider having a flight which leaves at 11:40 am with 1 layover and is with American Airlines? The ticket for this flight will be costing $273 per passenger.

System: I'd be happy to help. Let's get some details to help narrow down the search. Where are you planning to travel to and where will you be leaving from? What day will you be travelling?
User: I'll be leaving Los Angeles this Saturday bound for New York.
System: There are 5 flights that might work for you. There is an Alaska Airlines flight that leaves Los Angeles at 4:55 am local time. It has 1 layover and tickets cost $297.
User: Can you tell me where and when that flight lands?
System: It is scheduled to arrive at 3:56 pm local time at JFK International Airport.
User: That will work for me.

User: I'd like to fly on the 10th of March.
System: What city are you leaving from, and where are you traveling to?
User: I'm leaving from London and going to Seattle, I have 0 bags to check in, I'm just bringing a carry-on, I hate traveling while loaded down.
System: Okay! I've got 3 matching flights here - American Airlines has a flight with 1 layover, taking off at 2:25 am for $410 per passenger.
User: What class would it be and when does it arrive?
System: The flight arrives on the same day - it's an Economy seat.
User: No, I think 2:25 am is too early to be flying Economy, tell me what else is available.
System: How about Delta Airlines? There's an 11:50 am take off with 1 layover for $411.
User: No. Okay, can you look up flights from Los Angeles?
System: I've got 3 more options here: Alaska Airlines has a flight taking off at 8:15 am with 0 layovers for $153 per passenger.
User: Can you find some round trip flights instead, I need 2 seats.
